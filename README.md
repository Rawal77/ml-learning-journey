# ml-learning-journey
A well-structured repository showcasing my journey through Python and ML concepts, documenting each step of progress


## Progress

**Day 1:** Python Fundamentals
  - Covered basics like "Hello World" and variables
  - Explored arithmetic and logical operators
  - Practiced useful functions: round(), divmod(), isinstance()
  - Documented with comments for better understanding

**Day 2:** Exploring File Handling and OOP in Python
  - Learned how to read, write, and append data to text files.
  - Discovered the convenience of the with statement for automatically closing files.
  - Classes and Objects: Understood how to model real-world entities using Python classes.

**Day 3:** Exploring Advanced Functions in Python
  - Explored the power of lambda functions for creating concise, anonymous functions.
  - Learned how to use filter(), map(), and reduce() to process and transform data efficiently.

**Day 4:** Introduction to Numpy
  - Explored the fundamentals of NumPy and created 1D, 2D, and 3D arrays to understand their structure and behavior.
  - Learned about array attributes like shape, size, dtype, and ndim, which help analyze and manipulate arrays.
  - Practiced reshaping arrays and converting between data types, such as int, float, and datetime.
  - Gained hands-on experience with array methods like sum(), mean(), min(), and max() for quick data analysis.

**Day 5:** Exploring Numpy, Arrays, Methods and Broadcasting
  - Explored the difference between array and ndarray in NumPy.
  - Learned array methods for reshaping, axis-specific operations, and calculations like sum, mean, min, and max.
  - Practiced creating arrays using zeros, ones, and asarray from lists and tuples.
  - Understood broadcasting rules for performing operations on arrays with different shapes.
  - Discovered how to create arrays from iterables using fromiter.

**Day 6:**  NumPy â€“ Iteration, Updates, and Array Manipulation
  - Practiced generating numerical ranges using arange, linspace, and logspace.
  - Explored array iteration with standard loops, nditer, and ndenumerate for advanced traversal.
  - Learned to update arrays using fill, indexing, put, and condition-based updates.
  - Worked on array manipulation techniques like reshaping, flattening (flatten, ravel), concatenation, and splitting 
    arrays.
