# ml-learning-journey
A well-structured repository showcasing my journey through Python and ML concepts, documenting each step of progress


## Progress

**Day 1:** Python Fundamentals
  - Covered basics like "Hello World" and variables
  - Explored arithmetic and logical operators
  - Practiced useful functions: round(), divmod(), isinstance()
  - Documented with comments for better understanding

**Day 2:** Exploring File Handling and OOP in Python
  - Learned how to read, write, and append data to text files.
  - Discovered the convenience of the with statement for automatically closing files.
  - Classes and Objects: Understood how to model real-world entities using Python classes.

**Day 3:** Exploring Advanced Functions in Python
  - Explored the power of lambda functions for creating concise, anonymous functions.
  - Learned how to use filter(), map(), and reduce() to process and transform data efficiently.

**Day 4:** Introduction to Numpy
  - Explored the fundamentals of NumPy and created 1D, 2D, and 3D arrays to understand their structure and behavior.
  - Learned about array attributes like shape, size, dtype, and ndim, which help analyze and manipulate arrays.
  - Practiced reshaping arrays and converting between data types, such as int, float, and datetime.
  - Gained hands-on experience with array methods like sum(), mean(), min(), and max() for quick data analysis.

**Day 5:** Exploring Numpy, Arrays, Methods and Broadcasting
  - Explored the difference between array and ndarray in NumPy.
  - Learned array methods for reshaping, axis-specific operations, and calculations like sum, mean, min, and max.
  - Practiced creating arrays using zeros, ones, and asarray from lists and tuples.
  - Understood broadcasting rules for performing operations on arrays with different shapes.
  - Discovered how to create arrays from iterables using fromiter.

**Day 6:**  NumPy – Iteration, Updates, and Array Manipulation
  - Practiced generating numerical ranges using arange, linspace, and logspace.
  - Explored array iteration with standard loops, nditer, and ndenumerate for advanced traversal.
  - Learned to update arrays using fill, indexing, put, and condition-based updates.
  - Worked on array manipulation techniques like reshaping, flattening (flatten, ravel), concatenation, and splitting 
    arrays.

**Day 7:**  NumPy – String Manipulation and Mathematical Functions
  - Performed string manipulations like concatenation with char.add(), title-casing with char.title(), and splitting, joining, and replacing characters in arrays.
  - Applied bitwise operations like bitwise_and() for array-level binary calculations.
  - Worked with trigonometric functions (sin, cos, arccos) and mathematical functions (exp, power, absolute, log).
  - Performed arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, and division, and explored statistical functions (mean, median, std, var) for data analysis.

**Day 8:**  NumPy – Indexing, Sorting, Searching, and Views
  - Practiced fancy indexing and boolean indexing to select and filter array elements efficiently.
  - Sorted arrays using np.sort(), argsort(), and axis-based sorting for multi-dimensional arrays.
  - Explored searching techniques like np.searchsorted(), np.where(), np.argwhere(), and np.nonzero() to locate elements based on conditions.
  - Worked on filtering arrays using boolean indexing, np.where(), np.extract(), and np.compress() with masks.

**Day 9:**  Pandas – Introduction and Core Data Structures
  - Learned about Series, a one-dimensional labeled array, and practiced creating Series from lists, tuples, and string values.
  - Worked with DataFrames, a two-dimensional tabular data structure, and created DataFrames using dictionaries.
  - Understood that Panels, previously used for three-dimensional data, are now deprecated, and explored concatenation as an alternative
